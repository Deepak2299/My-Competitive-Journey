# My-Competitive-Journey

>Documenting my competitive programming journey from begining :wink: . Nowadays it has becomed so important as every hiring process has a CP round. If someone want to survive in that round then he have to do it daily.
>If you want to enter in a product based company then you have to be very good at CP, DS and Algo. As CP shows how much a candidate is good in problem solving.
